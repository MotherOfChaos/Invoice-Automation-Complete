## 💡 CLIENT OBJECTION HANDLERS

### "That sounds expensive..."
**Response:**
> "Actually, most small businesses pay $0/month because the first 1,000 invoices are free. Even if you process 2,000 invoices, it's only $1.50/month - less than a cup of coffee. Compare that to paying an employee $20/hour to manually enter invoice data for 10-20 hours per month."

### "Can we avoid the Vision API cost?"
**Response:**
> "Yes! We can disable the Vision API and you'd have $0 monthly costs. The system would still automatically organize all your invoices into folders, create spreadsheets, and prevent duplicates. You'd just need to manually enter the invoice data into the spreadsheet instead of having it extracted automatically."

**Follow-up:**
> "Most clients find the automatic extraction worth the $0-3/month because it saves them hours of manual work. But the choice is yours!"

### "What if we exceed the free tier?"
**Response:**
> "You'd get an email notification when approaching the free tier limit. At that point, you can:
> 1. Continue with minimal cost ($1.50 per 1,000 invoices)
> 2. Temporarily disable Vision API until next month
> 3. Upgrade your Google Cloud billing to handle larger volumes
>
> For context, processing 2,000 invoices costs $1.50/month but saves 15-20 hours of employee time."
