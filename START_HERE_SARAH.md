## OPTION 1: Upload to GitHub (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create the Repo (if not exists)
1. Go to https://github.com/MotherOfChaos
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: `Invoice-Automation-Complete`
4. Make it **Private**
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Files via Web Interface
1. In the new repo, click "Add file" → "Upload files"
2. Drag ALL files from this package:
   - `BRIEFING_FOR_CODY_REVISED.md`
   - `documentation/` folder (all 3 files inside)
3. Commit message: "Initial briefing for invoice automation"
4. Click "Commit changes"

### Step 3: Get Link for Cody
The main briefing file will be at:
```

```

**Give Cody this link!**

---

## OPTION 2: Direct File Share (If Cody can read files)

If Cody can read attached files directly:

1. Download these files from M:
   - `BRIEFING_FOR_CODY_REVISED.md` (main file)
   - `CONFIGURATION_CHECKLIST.md` (verification)
   - `VERSION_HISTORY_TEMPLATE.md` (to fill in)
   - `CLIENT_CUSTOMIZATION_GUIDE.md` (for selling product)

2. Share with Cody however you normally would

---

## OPTION 3: Copy/Paste (Last Resort)

If neither option works:

1. Open `BRIEFING_FOR_CODY_REVISED.md`
2. Copy entire contents
3. Paste into Cody chat
4. Say: "Please build this system following all specifications"
